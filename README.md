## Iron Scripter Challenge

---

Module to create __nonsense__ words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents.  Allows for adding markdown formatting as well.

Created by Russell Roefer

The nonsensical words are generated with the letters having a 75% chance of alternating from vowel to consonant and back.  You may generate words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents.  You may also choose to add Markdown formatting for a little more fun.
